# Guide: Clean Metadata Script

This guide provides instructions on how to use the `clean-metadata.sh` script, a privacy-focused tool for removing sensitive metadata from documents and images while optimizing file sizes.

## 1. Overview

The `clean-metadata.sh` script automates metadata removal and file optimization to help protect your privacy when sharing or archiving files. It is designed to be run on-demand and works with PDF, PNG, and JPEG files.

The script performs the following operations:
- **Metadata Removal**: Strips all EXIF, IPTC, XMP, and embedded metadata using `exiftool`
- **PDF Optimization**: Compresses PDFs using Ghostscript while removing embedded streams and metadata
- **PNG Optimization**: Reduces PNG file size using `pngquant` while maintaining visual quality
- **JPEG Optimization**: Compresses JPEG files using `jpegoptim` while removing metadata
- **Smart Comparison**: Automatically skips optimization if the result would be larger than the cleaned version
- **Batch Processing**: Supports processing individual files or entire directories recursively
- **Command-line Options**: Control behavior with `--help`, `--replace`, and `--verbose` flags

## 2. Dependencies

Before running the script, you must ensure that the required tools are installed. You can install them using `dnf`:

```bash
sudo dnf install exiftool ghostscript pngquant jpegoptim coreutils
```

**Package breakdown**:
- `exiftool` — Metadata removal tool
- `ghostscript` — PDF processing and optimization
- `pngquant` — PNG compression
- `jpegoptim` — JPEG compression and optimization
- `coreutils` — Contains `numfmt` for human-readable file sizes (pre-installed on Fedora)

**Optional** (for secure file deletion):
- `coreutils` includes `shred`, used by the `--replace` option for secure deletion

The script will check for these dependencies and will exit if they are not found.

## 3. Installation & Setup

### First Time Setup

Follow these steps to set up the script on your system:

1. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/clean-metadata.sh
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create an alias for easy access**:
   
   Add this to your `~/.bashrc`:
   ```bash
   alias cleanmeta='bash "$HOME/user-scripts/scripts/clean-metadata.sh"'
   ```
   
   Then reload your shell:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. **Test the installation**:
   ```bash
   cleanmeta --help
   ```
   
   You should see the usage message with available options. If not, verify all dependencies are installed.

## 4. Command-line Options

The script supports the following options:

### `--help` / `-h`

Display usage information and available options:

```bash
cleanmeta --help
```

### `--verbose`

Show metadata before cleaning (useful for verification):

```bash
cleanmeta --verbose document.pdf
```

By default, metadata is not displayed to protect privacy. Use this flag only when you need to verify what will be removed.

### `--replace`

Replace the original file with the cleaned version instead of creating a `_cleaned_opt` copy:

```bash
cleanmeta --replace sensitive.pdf
```

⚠️ **Important**: This option is permanent. The script will attempt to securely delete the original file using `shred` if available. Use with caution.

## 5. How to Run the Script

The script does not require root privileges and can be run as a regular user.

### Basic Usage (Single File)

To clean metadata and optimize a single file:

```bash
cleanmeta /path/to/file.pdf
```

Or if you created the alias:
```bash
cleanmeta ~/Documents/sensitive-file.png
```

### Processing Directories

To process all supported files in a directory (recursively):

```bash
cleanmeta ~/Documents/
```

The script will find and process all `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.jpeg` files in the directory and its subdirectories.

### Processing Multiple Files

You can also specify multiple files or directories at once:

```bash
cleanmeta file1.pdf file2.png ~/Downloads/
```

### Handling Spaces in Filenames

For files with spaces, use quotes or escape the spaces:

```bash
cleanmeta "My Document.pdf"
```

Or:

```bash
cleanmeta My\ Document.pdf
```

### Skip Already Processed Files

The script automatically skips files that have already been processed (those containing `_cleaned` or `_cleaned_opt` in their filename), preventing duplicate processing.

### Combining Options

You can combine multiple options:

```bash
cleanmeta --verbose --replace sensitive.pdf
```

## 6. Configurable Quality Settings

You can control the optimization quality for each file type by setting environment variables:

### PNG Quality

Default: `65-80` (good quality, strong compression)

```bash
PNG_QUALITY=75-85 cleanmeta image.png      # Slightly better quality
PNG_QUALITY=50-60 cleanmeta image.png      # Smaller file size
```

### JPEG Quality

Default: `80` (good quality, moderate compression)

```bash
JPEG_QUALITY=85 cleanmeta photo.jpg        # Better quality
JPEG_QUALITY=70 cleanmeta photo.jpg        # Smaller file size
```

### PDF Settings

Default: `/ebook` (ebook quality, good for documents)

```bash
PDF_SETTINGS=/screen cleanmeta book.pdf    # Lower quality, more compression
PDF_SETTINGS=/print cleanmeta book.pdf     # Higher quality, less compression
```

### Ghostscript Device

Default: `pdfwrite` (standard PDF output)

```bash
GS_DEVICE=pdfwrite cleanmeta file.pdf      # Standard PDF
```

## 7. Understanding the Output

The script provides real-time feedback on its operations.

### On-Screen Output

For each file processed, you'll see:

```
────────────────────────────────────────────
📋 Processing: /path/to/file.pdf
Found metadata:
[PDF]           Author                          : John Doe
[PDF]           Create Date                     : 2025:06:15 10:30:00Z
[XMP-dc]        Title                           : Sensitive Document
🧹 Cleaning all metadata...
📰 Optimizing PDF...
✓ Metadata removed:
   (clean)
📊 Size: Before:    2.5MB → After:    2.1MB | Δ -   512KB
────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Output Components

- **📋 Processing**: Shows the file being processed
- **Found metadata** (when using `--verbose`): Displays significant metadata that will be removed (Author, Title, Creator, dates, etc.)
- **🧹 Cleaning**: Removes all metadata
- **📰/🌆/📸 Optimizing**: Indicates which optimization is being applied (PDF/PNG/JPEG)
- **✓ Metadata removed**: Confirms that all metadata has been successfully stripped
- **📊 Size**: Shows the original size, final size, and change in bytes

### Error and Warning Messages

- **⚠️ Warnings**: Non-critical issues (file already processed, optimization skipped, etc.)
- **❌ Errors**: Critical failures requiring user attention

## 8. Output Files

By default, for each processed file, the script creates a new file with the suffix `_cleaned_opt`:

**Original**: `document.pdf`  
**Processed**: `document_cleaned_opt.pdf`

The original file is never modified unless you use the `--replace` option. You can safely delete the original once you've verified the cleaned version is acceptable.

### Using `--replace`

With the `--replace` option, the script replaces the original file:

```bash
cleanmeta --replace sensitive.pdf
```

Result:
- Original `sensitive.pdf` is securely deleted using `shred` (if available)
- Cleaned version replaces the original filename
- Final result: `sensitive.pdf` (containing only cleaned data)

## 9. File Optimization Details

The script applies format-specific optimizations:

### PDF Optimization

- **Default Setting**: ebook quality (`/ebook`)
- **Result**: Typically 10-40% size reduction
- **Quality**: Slight visual reduction (acceptable for most documents)
- **Privacy benefit**: Removes embedded streams and object structures
- **Override**: `PDF_SETTINGS=/screen cleanmeta file.pdf` for more compression

### PNG Optimization

- **Quality**: 65-80% (visually lossless by default)
- **Speed**: Prioritizes quality over compression speed
- **Result**: Typically 30-70% size reduction depending on image complexity
- **Override**: `PNG_QUALITY=50-60 cleanmeta image.png` for more compression

### JPEG Optimization

- **Quality**: Maximum 80% by default (balanced quality/size)
- **Metadata**: All metadata and comments removed
- **Result**: Typically 10-30% size reduction
- **Override**: `JPEG_QUALITY=70 cleanmeta photo.jpg` for smaller file size

### Smart Comparison

If the optimized file ends up larger than the cleaned (non-optimized) version, the script automatically skips optimization and uses the smaller cleaned file instead:

```
⚠️ Optimized file is not smaller, using cleaned file.
```

This ensures you always get the smallest possible result.

## 10. Supported File Types

| Format | Metadata Removed | Optimization | Output Size Impact | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| PDF | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (ebook quality) | Often reduced | Text-heavy PDFs compress best |
| PNG | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (pngquant) | Usually 30-70% smaller | Lossless compression |
| JPEG | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (jpegoptim) | Typically 10-30% smaller | Lossy compression |
| JPG | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (jpegoptim) | Typically 10-30% smaller | Same as JPEG |

## 11. Security & Privacy Considerations

The `clean-metadata.sh` script is designed with security and privacy as the primary goals:

- **All data stays local**: Cleaned files are stored only on your local system
- **No external transmission**: The script never sends any data to external servers
- **No telemetry**: The script collects no usage statistics or personal information
- **Transparent operations**: You can see exactly what metadata is being removed (with `--verbose`)
- **User control**: You manually invoke the script; no automatic background processing
- **Symlink protection**: Script rejects symbolic links to prevent exploitation
- **Path traversal protection**: Malicious filenames cannot write outside the source directory
- **Secure deletion**: Uses `shred` for secure file deletion with `--replace` option

### What Gets Removed

**From all files**:
- EXIF data (camera model, GPS location, timestamps)
- IPTC data (keywords, author, copyright)
- XMP data (creation tool, modification dates)
- File comments and descriptions

**From PDFs additionally**:
- Author, Creator, Title, Subject
- Embedded producer information
- Modification dates and timestamps
- Document ID and version information

### Metadata Display

By default, metadata is **not displayed** to protect your privacy. If a log file is created from output, sensitive information won't be visible:

```bash
# Metadata is shown (verbose mode):
cleanmeta --verbose file.pdf

# Metadata is hidden (default):
cleanmeta file.pdf

# Redirect to log safely (sensitive data not logged):
cleanmeta file.pdf > cleanup.log
```

To prevent any output while processing:
```bash
cleanmeta file.pdf > /dev/null 2>&1
```

## 12. Common Use Cases

### Before Sharing a Document

Clean metadata before sending to colleagues or uploading to the web:

```bash
cleanmeta ~/Documents/quarterly-report.pdf
# Then share: ~/Documents/quarterly-report_cleaned_opt.pdf
```

### Batch Processing Screenshots

Remove metadata from a folder of screenshots:

```bash
cleanmeta ~/Pictures/Screenshots/
```

### Preparing Images for Web

Optimize and clean images before uploading to a website:

```bash
cleanmeta ~/website-images/
```

### Archiving Sensitive Documents

Clean sensitive files before archiving:

```bash
cleanmeta ~/sensitive-files/
# Then archive the _cleaned_opt versions
tar -czf archive.tar.gz ~/sensitive-files/*_cleaned_opt*
```

### Safe File Replacement

Replace original with cleaned version:

```bash
cleanmeta --replace ~/Documents/tax-return.pdf
# Result: original is securely deleted, cleaned version replaces it
```

## 13. Performance Notes

- **Small files** (< 1 MB): Process in seconds
- **Medium files** (1-10 MB): Process in 10-60 seconds depending on format
- **Large files** (> 10 MB): May take 60+ seconds (GS and pngquant are comprehensive)
- **Batch processing**: Significantly faster than processing files individually (I/O optimization)

### Tips for Better Performance

- Process directories instead of individual files when possible
- For large batches, consider adjusting quality settings for faster processing:
  ```bash
  PNG_QUALITY=50-60 JPEG_QUALITY=70 cleanmeta ~/large-batch/
  ```

## 14. Troubleshooting

### Error: Dependency Not Found

If you receive an error about a missing dependency:

```bash
sudo dnf install exiftool ghostscript pngquant jpegoptim coreutils
```

Then retry the command.

### Symlink Rejected

The script now rejects symbolic links for security:

```bash
⚠️ Symbolic links are not supported: /path/to/link
```

To process a file behind a symlink, resolve the actual file:

```bash
# Instead of:
cleanmeta /path/to/symlink.pdf

# Use:
cleanmeta $(readlink -e /path/to/symlink.pdf)
```

### File Not Found Warning

If you see `⚠️ Not found: filename`, verify the file path exists:

```bash
ls /path/to/file
```

### Already Processed File Warning

If the script says a file is being ignored as already processed, it contains `_cleaned` or `_cleaned_opt` in its filename. To process it again, rename it:

```bash
mv file_cleaned_opt.pdf file.pdf
cleanmeta file.pdf
```

### Unsupported File Type

The script only supports PDF, PNG, JPG, and JPEG files. Other formats are skipped:

```bash
⚠️ Unsupported file type: /path/to/file.docx (extension: docx)
```

### File Has No Extension

Files must have recognized extensions. Rename the file to include an extension:

```bash
mv document document.pdf
cleanmeta document.pdf
```

### Output File Already Exists

By default, the script prevents overwriting existing output files:

```bash
❌ Error: File already exists or move failed: /path/to/file_cleaned_opt.pdf
```

To handle this:
- Rename or move the existing file, then reprocess
- Use `--replace` to directly overwrite the original

### Optimized File Larger Than Cleaned

This is normal for some files. The script automatically uses the smaller cleaned version without optimization. This can happen if:
- The original file has little compressible data
- The file is already well-optimized
- The format doesn't compress well for that particular image/document

### Character Encoding Issues with Filenames

If filenames contain special characters, use quotes:

```bash
cleanmeta "файл с кириллицей.pdf"
```

### Permission Denied Error

Ensure you have read permissions on the source file and write permissions on the directory:

```bash
chmod u+r ~/Documents/file.pdf        # Read permission
chmod u+w ~/Documents/                # Write permission on directory
cleanmeta ~/Documents/file.pdf
```

## 15. Best Practices

- **Review before sharing**: Always open the `_cleaned_opt` file to verify it looks correct before deleting the original
- **Test with non-critical files first**: If this is your first time using the script, practice with unimportant files
- **Keep originals temporarily**: Don't delete the original files immediately; verify the cleaned versions are acceptable
- **Batch processing**: Process folders instead of individual files for better performance
- **Archive cleaned versions only**: For sensitive documents, keep only the cleaned versions in your archive
- **Schedule regular cleanup**: Periodically run the script on documents before archiving
- **Use `--verbose` cautiously**: Only use verbose mode when necessary, and don't log output containing sensitive metadata
- **Verify secure deletion**: When using `--replace`, verify that `shred` is available if secure deletion is critical:
  ```bash
  command -v shred && echo "shred available" || echo "shred not available"
  ```

## 16. Examples

### Clean a Single PDF and Verify

```bash
cleanmeta ~/Documents/contract.pdf
# Review the output
file ~/Documents/contract_cleaned_opt.pdf
# If satisfied, delete original:
rm ~/Documents/contract.pdf
```

### Process All Screenshots with Verbose Output

```bash
cleanmeta --verbose ~/Pictures/Screenshots/
```

### Clean Multiple Directories

```bash
cleanmeta ~/Documents/ ~/Downloads/ ~/Pictures/
```

### Create a Private Archive (Replace Originals)

```bash
mkdir ~/temp-processing
cleanmeta --replace ~/sensitive-docs/
# Original files are replaced with cleaned versions
tar -czf archive.tar.gz ~/sensitive-docs/*.pdf ~/sensitive-docs/*.png
```

### Optimize for Web (Higher Compression)

```bash
PNG_QUALITY=50-60 JPEG_QUALITY=70 cleanmeta ~/website-images/
ls ~/website-images/*_cleaned_opt*
```

### Monitor Large Batch Processing

```bash
cleanmeta ~/large-batch/ 2>&1 | tee processing.log
# Review processing.log for any errors
```
